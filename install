scikit-build (needed before opencv-python)

opencv-python
    note: very long hang time

    Depends on Pillow, ewhich needs apt-get to install libjpeg-dev and zlib1g-dev
tflite

issues:
    Tensorflow
        pis are x32, default tensorflow is x64
        tflite
            Only can run classification, not training
            probably better to run on the pi

Project notes and questions we need to be able to answer:
    Can train locally and classfy on the pi as long as we justify the need.
    We can upload the model after local training or connect the PC to the pi, as long as we can justify that
    Must be automated / automatable and scalabe, however
    How do we deal with disconnection?
