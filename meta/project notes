Project notes and questions we need to be able to answer:
    Can train locally and classfy on the pi as long as we justify the need.
    We can upload the model after local training or connect the PC to the pi, as long as we can justify that
    Must be automated / automatable and scalabe, however
    How do we deal with disconnection?
    How are we sure the tflite model has similar accuracy to the tensorflow model?
